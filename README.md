# AlgoD
D implementations of various data structures and algorithms problems
### Disclaimer :
These may not be the most optimized or prettiest implementations. The goal is mainly to:
*  learn and practice using features of D and
*  make simple implementations that may be useful to people looking for something relatively easy to understand.
